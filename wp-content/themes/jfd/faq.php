                        <h4>Do you guys do SEO optimization?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Not only do we create crisp websites, we also partake in doing an SEO Boost to improve your rankings in popular search engines like Google or Bing. We are able to acheive these results by using software that can analyze and suggest certain adjustments to make in the website that will allow search engine web crawling bots index your site a lot easier.

                        </p>


                        <h4>Do you create E-commerce sites?</h4>
                        <p>
                            At this time, we do not do this. But, we are training developers at the moment to be knowledgeable about it so that in the future we can service the people who need this assistance.

                        </p>

                        <h4>What is the average time it would take to finish a web project?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Well, that entirely depends on how big and complex the website will be. For a five page website that will be stylized, responsively designed, have dynamic javascript applications, and simple data/querying functionality. I would assume a month or so. But, if the project that you are desiring are going to be 5 static pages, then it probably is not going to take that long and maybe take less than 3 weeks. It might be even 2 weeks if we don't have that many clients to work with. But, for a basic web project it will take a month or so to get it done, if there are not any other variables that we are considering

                        <p>
                            For a simple website that will have about 5 pages developed I have a flate rate of $500. This job will include

                            For websites that will be more than 5 pages, we charge an additional $250 for every 5 page increment. So that means if you want a 10 page or a 6 page website the flat fee will be $750. If you want a 15 page website it will be $1000 and so forth
